# tinyGAN

A demo project to test my understanding of Generative Networks by creating a simple Generative Adversarial Network. This project does not use any prewritten Deep Learning libraries.

The goal is to have the GAN produce a checkered pattern, with the top left and bottom right squares white and the top right and bottom left squares black.
